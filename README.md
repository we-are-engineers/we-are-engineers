# We Are Engineers

## Work In Progress

## Why
Engineers are held to a standard of ethics. These standards save lives.

Programmers need a standard.

## What
The aim is for there to be a few short rules, and each rule will be expanded upon in a separate document.

example rules, not set
1. First, do no harm
2. Tell the truth
3. Be secure
4. Treat all people as people
5. Grow yourself

## How
This standard is growing. Pull requests are welcome.

## Who
So far, [Joseph Levine](https://github.com/adauctus). Maybe you!
